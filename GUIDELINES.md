**Decoration Rules**

1. No pornography, gore, etc (No NSFW). **Violating this rule will result in you being banned from creating new decorations.**
2. No excessive flashing.
3. No political content.
4. **No re-uploaded collectible store decorations.**
4. Must be decorative, not just a random picture.
5. The Decor team reserves the right to deny decorations for any reason.
6. The Decor team also reserves the right to prevent you from creating decorations for violating the aforementioned rules.

**Decoration Specs**

Decorations are (A)PNG images that are square and 1.2x the size of your avatar.

There is no resolution limit (due to being unable to resize APNGs) but please be reasonable (under 1024x1024) and there is a maximum file size of 1MB.

Animated decorations will be split out into two files, A PNG of the first frame and the other being the full file.

**Process**

You can create your decoration using any client mod with a Decor plugin capable of creating decorations.

After creating it, you won't be able to use it until it is manually reviewed by a reviewer.

Please do not harass reviewers to review your decoration.

After your decoration is reviewed, if approved, it will be selected as your active decoration. Otherwise, it will be deleted.
