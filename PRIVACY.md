Your Discord user ID is saved when you first authorize with Decor.

Every time you authorize, basic user information including your user ID, display name (if applicable), username, discriminator (if applicable), avatar, and client mod used are logged to a private channel for analytic purposes.

When you create a decoration, reviewers will be able to see your user ID, display name or username, and avatar, on top of the decoration itself, it's hash (id), it's name, and whether it's animated.

By design, your selected decoration's hash and whether it's animated is shared with other users of Decor when requested.

Decorations created by you are linked to you, and anyone can see any decoration's author's user ID.

You can request your data to be removed by contacting @swiftui on Discord, or creating a GitHub issue on this repository with your user ID and proof that it's your account.
