Decor is a plugin for various Discord client mods that adds custom avatar decorations to Discord. The purpose of this privacy policy is to clearly explain what data is collected and how it is used. This policy is intended to be compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable laws.

### How we collect data
